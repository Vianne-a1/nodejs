## Phase 3: For the Record
A Devo/DDD will publish a "one-pager" distillation of their talk, so that any fellow Devo may revisit, delve deeper, run code snippets themselves, etc.

## Beyond
After this season's round of TEDxSoftDev talks, a Devo will be generally allowed to utilize any topic covered in a talk in future projects -- bypassing normal clearance protocol.
